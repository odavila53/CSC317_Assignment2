Assignment 1 – Installation of Linux, Node & Express

Description:
This assignment is to create a website solely in HTML and to focus on making a basic setup of an HTML page. There were 3 required fields, a home, contact, about page.
I decided to do the extra credit and make a FAQ page as well


Approach / What I Did:

When I made the new directory, I first started by creating four html files where I was able to edit them in the text editor. 
The home page was simple, by using “img scr=” to include the three photos, then I made the navigation at the bottom of the page to the 
other pages. The about page was also simple just adding some basic info such as my SFSU ID, github, and more. 
The contact page wasn’t too hard either. I added all the given requirements and added more such as phone number, 
“where you heard about us”, etc. Lastly for the FAQ page I added basic questions and responses to it. 

Issues and Resolutions:

Honestly, the work itself wasn’t what I had trouble with. Its pushing the files to the repository on github. 
I’m still having issues with pushing everything over. For my first attempt I accientically made another branch to the repository. 
When I tried combining the branches together it wouldn’t let me. I asked my classmates for help and they told me to use 
git add ., git commit, then git push, but that still didn’t work because it was sending everything to that branch I had made. 


Analysis:  

Throughout this assignment, I actually had a fun time researching and adding elements to the html file. Finding out how to put a text in a certain position was interesting to learn about. This was also my first time working with html form so I was able to play around with the different types such as “text”, “number”, “date”, etc.
